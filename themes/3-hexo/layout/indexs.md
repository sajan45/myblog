# Hello World
Welcome to my blog. I am Sajan Kumar, a Software Engineer. This blog is like a personal journal of mine but related to programming and related technology. It's a way to document anything I learn and a way to share what I find interesting, with the world.

All content on this blog reflects my personal opinions only; writing the posts and the programming explorations accompanying them are done in my free time. I never write on behalf of my employer in this blog.
